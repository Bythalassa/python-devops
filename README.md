## 📚 Course Structure

The repository is organized into modules, each corresponding to a section in the course. Here is an overview of what you will learn:

- **virtual-envs**: Learn why virtual environments are essential and how to use Python's built-in `venv` module to create and manage isolated project environments.

- **python-fundamentals**: Master the core building blocks of Python. This module covers variables, comments, data types (`str`, `int`, `list`, `dict`, `set`, `tuple`), conditionals, loops, functions, including `*args` and `**kwargs`, classes, among other topics

- **generators-decorators**: Explore advanced Python features that promote clean and efficient code. This section covers first-class functions, memory-efficient generators with `yield`, and powerful decorators for adding functionality like timing and retries.

- **error-handling**: Build resilient scripts by mastering error handling. This module covers the `try...except` block, raising built-in and custom exceptions, and using context managers for safe resource management.

- **logging**: Go beyond `print()` statements and learn to use Python's `logging` module. You'll explore logging levels, handlers, formatters, file-based logging with rotation, and modern structured logging with JSON.

- **files-regex-data-formats**: Dive into file I/O and data handling. You'll learn to work with filesystem paths using `pathlib`, process text with regular expressions (`re`), and handle common data serialization formats like **CSV**, **JSON**, and **YAML**.

- **interacting-with-os**: Write scripts that interact with the operating system. This module covers managing environment variables, executing external commands with `subprocess`, handling filesystem operations with `os` and `shutil`, and creating temporary files.

- **http-requests**: Learn to interact with web services and REST APIs using the powerful `requests` library. Topics include making GET/POST requests, passing parameters, handling authentication, and implementing robust error handling with retries and timeouts.

- **typing**: Improve code clarity and catch bugs early with Python's type hinting system. This module introduces basic and advanced types from the `typing` module, generics with `TypeVar`, and how to use static analysis tools like `mypy` to validate your code.

- **automated-testing**: Write professional, automated tests for your DevOps scripts using `pytest`. You will learn about assertions, fixtures for setup/teardown, markers for organizing tests, parametrization for DRY tests, and mocking external dependencies.

- **multi-file-projects**: Learn to structure larger Python applications. This module covers creating modules and packages (`__init__.py`), using absolute vs. relative imports, defining project metadata with `pyproject.toml`, and setting up a testable project layout.
